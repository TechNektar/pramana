# Problem

Consider four logical statements P, Q, R, and S. The following information is known:

**Given Facts**:
1. If P is true, then Q is true
2. If Q is true, then R is true
3. If R is true, then S is true
4. P is true

**Question**: What are the truth values of P, Q, R, and S?

## Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)

**Doubt Type**: Viparyaya Samshaya (Doubt arising from chain of implications)

**Justification**: We have a chain of conditional statements: P → Q → R → S. While P is given as true, the truth values of Q, R, and S depend on whether the implications hold. Without systematically applying modus ponens through the chain, we cannot determine the truth values of Q, R, and S with certainty. The doubt arises from the need to trace implications step by step.

### Pratyaksha (Direct Perception)

```yaml
observable_facts:
  - "If P is true, then Q is true"
  - "If Q is true, then R is true"
  - "If R is true, then S is true"
  - "P is true"
  - "There are four statements: P, Q, R, S"
  - "Each statement is either true or false"
```

**Note**: These are the only directly stated facts. The truth values of Q, R, and S are not directly observed but must be inferred.

### Anumana (Inference)

```yaml
inferences:
  - type: purvavat
    premise: "P is true (fact 4), and if P is true then Q is true (fact 1)"
    conclusion: "Q is true"
    justification: "Modus ponens: from P and P → Q, we derive Q"
  
  - type: purvavat
    premise: "Q is true (from inference 1), and if Q is true then R is true (fact 2)"
    conclusion: "R is true"
    justification: "Modus ponens: from Q and Q → R, we derive R"
  
  - type: purvavat
    premise: "R is true (from inference 2), and if R is true then S is true (fact 3)"
    conclusion: "S is true"
    justification: "Modus ponens: from R and R → S, we derive S"
  
  - type: samanyatodrishta
    premise: "P → Q, Q → R, R → S, and P is true"
    conclusion: "By transitivity of implication: P → S, and since P is true, S is true"
    justification: "Transitive chain: if P → Q and Q → R and R → S, then P → S. Combined with P being true, we get S is true"
```

### Upamana (Comparison)

```yaml
analogies:
  - reference: "Mathematical proof chains and logical deduction"
    similarity: "This problem follows the same structure as a mathematical proof where each step follows from the previous one. Just as we can prove that if a > b and b > c and c > d, then a > d, we apply the same transitive reasoning to logical implications. The structure is isomorphic to applying modus ponens repeatedly through a chain of conditionals"
```

### Shabda (Testimony)

```yaml
principles:
  - "Modus Ponens: If P → Q is true and P is true, then Q is true. This is a fundamental rule of logical inference"
  - "Transitivity of Implication: If P → Q and Q → R, then P → R. This allows chaining implications"
  - "Law of Excluded Middle: Each statement is either true or false, with no third possibility"
  - "Deductive Closure: If we can derive Q from P through a valid chain of reasoning, and P is true, then Q is true"

## Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)

### Syllogism 1: Establishing Q from P

**Pratijna (Thesis)**: Q is true.

**Hetu (Reason)**: P is true (given fact 4), and if P is true then Q is true (given fact 1). By modus ponens, Q must be true.

**Udaharana (Universal + Example)**: Wherever we have a conditional statement "If A then B" and we know A is true, we can conclude B is true. For example, if we know "If it is raining, then the ground is wet" and we observe that it is raining, we can conclude the ground is wet. This universal rule of modus ponens applies to all conditional reasoning.

**Upanaya (Application)**: In this specific problem, we have "If P is true, then Q is true" (fact 1) and "P is true" (fact 4). Applying the universal rule of modus ponens: Q is true.

**Nigamana (Conclusion)**: Therefore, Q is true.

### Syllogism 2: Establishing R from Q

**Pratijna (Thesis)**: R is true.

**Hetu (Reason)**: Q is true (Syllogism 1), and if Q is true then R is true (given fact 2). By modus ponens, R must be true.

**Udaharana (Universal + Example)**: Wherever we apply modus ponens to a conditional, if the antecedent is true, the consequent follows. For example, if we know "If the door is locked, then we cannot enter" and we establish the door is locked, we conclude we cannot enter. This universal principle applies to all modus ponens applications.

**Upanaya (Application)**: We have "If Q is true, then R is true" (fact 2) and Q is true (Syllogism 1). Applying modus ponens: R is true.

**Nigamana (Conclusion)**: Therefore, R is true.

### Syllogism 3: Establishing S from R

**Pratijna (Thesis)**: S is true.

**Hetu (Reason)**: R is true (Syllogism 2), and if R is true then S is true (given fact 3). By modus ponens, S must be true.

**Udaharana (Universal + Example)**: Wherever we have a chain of modus ponens applications, each step follows the same universal rule: conditional + true antecedent → true consequent. For example, in a proof chain where each step follows from the previous, we apply modus ponens repeatedly. This universal pattern applies to all deductive chains.

**Upanaya (Application)**: We have "If R is true, then S is true" (fact 3) and R is true (Syllogism 2). Applying modus ponens: S is true.

**Nigamana (Conclusion)**: Therefore, S is true.

### Syllogism 4: Establishing Complete Truth Values Through Transitive Chain

**Pratijna (Thesis)**: All four statements P, Q, R, and S are true.

**Hetu (Reason)**: P is true (given), Q is true (Syllogism 1), R is true (Syllogism 2), S is true (Syllogism 3). Additionally, by transitivity of implication: P → Q, Q → R, R → S implies P → S. Since P is true, S is true, confirming our step-by-step derivation.

**Udaharana (Universal + Example)**: Wherever we have a transitive chain of implications A → B → C → D and we know A is true, we can conclude that B, C, and D are all true. For example, if we know "If it rains, then clouds form" and "If clouds form, then sky is cloudy" and "If sky is cloudy, then visibility decreases," and we observe it is raining, we can conclude all consequences follow: clouds form, sky is cloudy, and visibility decreases. This universal principle applies to all transitive implication chains.

**Upanaya (Application)**: We have the chain P → Q → R → S (from facts 1, 2, 3) and P is true (fact 4). By the universal principle of transitive implication chains: Q is true, R is true, and S is true. This confirms our step-by-step modus ponens derivations.

**Nigamana (Conclusion)**: Therefore, all four statements P, Q, R, and S are true.

## Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)

**Hypothesis**: Suppose Q is not true (i.e., Q is false).

**Consequence**: If Q is false, then from fact 1 "If P is true, then Q is true," we have P → Q. If P is true and Q is false, then P → Q is false. But fact 1 states P → Q is true (it's given as a fact). Also, fact 4 states P is true. So we would have: P is true, P → Q is true (from fact 1), but Q is false. This violates modus ponens: if P → Q is true and P is true, then Q must be true. This is a contradiction.

**Analysis**: The hypothesis leads to a logical contradiction. We cannot have P true, P → Q true, and Q false simultaneously. This violates the fundamental rule of modus ponens.

**Resolution**: Therefore, Q must be true.

**Additional Tarka Test**: Suppose S is not true (i.e., S is false). Then, from fact 3 "If R is true, then S is true," if R is true and S is false, then R → S would be false. But fact 3 states R → S is true. Also, we have established R is true (from Q being true and Q → R). So we would have: R is true, R → S is true, but S is false. This again violates modus ponens, creating a contradiction. Therefore, S must be true.

**Further Tarka**: Suppose the chain breaks somewhere (e.g., R is false even though Q is true). Then from fact 2 "If Q is true, then R is true," if Q is true and R is false, then Q → R is false. But fact 2 states Q → R is true. Since we have Q is true (from P being true and P → Q), we would have a contradiction. Therefore, the chain cannot break: if P is true, then Q, R, and S must all be true.

## Nirnaya (Ascertainment)

**Status**: Definitive Knowledge

**Final Answer**: P is true, Q is true, R is true, and S is true. All four statements are true.

**Justification**: P is given as true (fact 4). Through systematic application of modus ponens: from P and P → Q, we derive Q is true; from Q and Q → R, we derive R is true; from R and R → S, we derive S is true. The reasoning follows valid logical principles: modus ponens is applied correctly at each step, and the transitive chain confirms the result. Tarka testing confirms the conclusions through reductio ad absurdum: denying any of Q, R, or S leads to contradiction with the given facts and modus ponens. The answer is logically necessary and verifiable.

**Confidence**: High - The solution is logically necessary given the facts. The chain of modus ponens applications is valid, and no alternative truth value assignment satisfies all given implications while keeping P true. The answer is complete and certain.
